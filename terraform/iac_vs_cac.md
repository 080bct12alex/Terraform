**Infrastructure as Code**
 - IaC refers to the management and provisioning of infrastructure through code rather than manual processes, such as creating an EC2 instance, highlighting the automation of infrastructure setup.

---

**Configuration Management as Code**
- Provisioning infrastructure with tools like Terraform , Cloud Formation enables the creation of resources such as EC2 instances, while configuration management tools like Ansible or Puppet are utilized for installing and managing databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL on EC2 instance.

*Key point:*
     
        Use terraform for setup 
        AND
        Ansible for install and deploy
